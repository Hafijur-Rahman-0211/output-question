// let a = [20];
// let b = [20];
// console.warn(a[0] == b[0]);  // Loose equality comparison
// console.warn(a[0] === b[0]); // Strict equality comparison

// Output: 
// true
// true

// Explanation:
// Accessing a[0] and b[0]:

// a[0] and b[0] both access the first element of their respective arrays.
// In this case, both are the number 20.
// a[0] == b[0] (Loose equality):

// Loose equality (==) compares the values after performing type conversion if necessary.
// Since 20 is a number in both cases, no type conversion is needed, and their values are equal. So, the result is true.
// a[0] === b[0] (Strict equality):

// Strict equality (===) compares both the value and type without type conversion.
// Both a[0] and b[0] are the number 20 and have the same type (number), so the result is true.
// Key Point:
// When comparing the values inside the arrays (a[0] and b[0]), JavaScript compares the actual numbers, not the array references. Since both are identical (20), both loose and strict equality return true.
